This is program collects student name and grade information using if and else to determine if they made the Dean's list or the Honor Roll.

Bug Report: *I had some issues with concactinating the strings in the beginning.  I also could not figure out the logic of incorporating a while statement/loop to restart the program until the user enters a True Boolean of "1" for yes.  Looking forward to feedback. ~T.Barlow
